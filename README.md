# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kar Lok, but I would prefer you just called me Kar.

I'm a backend focused developer, who is currently studying and working. I enjoy planning system architecture, building performant backend and doing all that unnecessary premature optimisations.

I'm familiar working with `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, `Rust` and `Go`.

I'm also currently developing a personal portfolio (LOL this doesn't seem like it'll ever be finished ðŸ’€).
